            <p>
              I worked on Firecracker, a memory efficient, fast booting VMM that
              allows AWS lambda to be profitable.
              <br /><br />
              Firecracker supports snapshotting a VM; a VM can be saved and
              restored much faster than booting a new one and much faster than
              any other VMM. I spent time working on the safety and
              configurability of this feature, this involved evaluating whether
              a snapshot could be safely restored on a given CPU considering its
              specified features and security mitigations, and those of the
              target. This involved analysis of the performance and security
              effects of CPU features on both x86-64 and aarch64, and ensuring
              we had an implementation that aligned with the specifications.
              <br /><br />
              Firecracker supports a feature called CPU templates that allows a
              user configurability of most of how the CPU is presented to the
              guest OS. This work required understanding the Intel x86-64, AMD
              x86-64 and Arm aarch64 specifications. Development involved
              thorough discussion with customers and within our team both
              focused on usability, security and robustness. I rewrote how
              Firecracker handles static CPU templates to support runtime CPU
              templates and wrote the foundational implementation for runtime
              CPU templates. I also implemented thorough compatibility checks
              for x86-64.
              <br /><br />
              I was the owner of an initiative to performance test Firecracker
              in production-like scenarios, through this we discovered and fixed
              significant performance regressions that may have costed AWS
              Lambda millions of dollars if they went live. This work involved
              coordinating across teams and diving deep into the deployment and
              management of resources to setup the required environment and
              execute the useful tests.
              <br /><br />
              In this role I and another team member adopted responsibility for
              maintenance of the
              <a href="https://github.com/rust-vmm">rust-vmm</a> open source
              organization that maintained components used by Firecracker and
              other VMMs such as

              This project was a victim of my student ambition while in
              university, I came to the conclusion that while I had learned a
              great amount and built a cool project it was too big to make it
              into a valuable product on my own. This led me to focus on smaller
              but more complex projects moving forward.
